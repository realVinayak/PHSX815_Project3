# PHSX815_Project3

The goal of this project is to investigate how accurately
the true rate parameter of an exponential distribution
can be measured from the experiments. 
<br/>
What I need review on
1. Does the code make sense and are there any portions
   which are unclear?
2. Is there any implementation error? I am using Neyman 
   construction. The plots are in ./outputs/
